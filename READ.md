# LIRI Bot

## Overview

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

## Highlights

To retrieve the data that will power the app, we use the `axios` package to search for concerts, Spotify package for songs and OMDB API for movies.

- [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)

- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

  - We use Axios to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)
